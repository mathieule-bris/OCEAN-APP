    This web application was developed in the context of a study investigating variability in the upper-ocean vertical structure
    of the tropical Pacific using daily temperature profiles from the TAO/TRITON mooring array (1979â€“2025). 
    The Sharp Homogenization/Diffusive Retreat (SHDR) algorithm was applied to derive mixed layer depth (MLD) and thermocline structure,
    with a focus on seasonal variability and its modulation by El NiÃ±oâ€“Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases.
    
    While the full scientific significance of the figures generated here was not explored in this project, 
    this app provides a user-friendly interface to explore the database created with the SHDR algorithm and most of the methods developed
    during the study. Users can visualize MLD time series, perform harmonic analysis by ENSO phase, and interact with seasonal variability plots.

    All the codes used to generate these analyses, as well as the data required, are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/mathieule-bris/OCEAN-APP),
    allowing anyone to reproduce the results or apply the tools to their own oceanographic datasets.
    
    **Acknowledgements**
    I would like to thank Raquel Somavilla and Ignasi VallÃ¨s Casanova for supervising and guiding me
    throughout this work. I would also like to thank CÃ©sar Gonzales Polla for reviewing my work. I would like also to thank these institutions ENSTA, IUEM, IMT Atlantique (universities) and CSIC - IEO Santander (Institute) for their support and collaboration.


    **Features:**
    -  Check and visualize Mixed Layer Depth (MLD) at multiple coordinates.
    -  Perform harmonic analysis based on ENSO phases (ONI classification).
    -  Explore seasonal variability and generate plots automatically.
    
    **How to use the app:**
    1. Select an analysis from the sidebar.
    2. Adjust parameters as needed.
    3. Click the 'Run' button to display results.
    
    This app is built in Python using Streamlit.
